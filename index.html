				<h4 id="anime">Anime:</h4>
				<p>"A style of japanese animated shows, aimed at adults and children."
				Anime is something that is certainly a big factor that affected who I am today. I would not be the person I am today, 
				if I hadn't watched the anime that I watched in my childhood and teenage years, that I am a 100% sure of. Seeing so 
				manycharacters grow and evolve over the years, is something that people in the past didn't have the chance to experience 
				the way my generation and the following ones have.It is very special and the anime shows have changed a lot over time, 
				so each one of them is more closely related to specific generations than others.
			 	Truth is; I don't have a  clear idea of what kind of anime is popular nowadays, however, I sadly believe that the quality
			 	has dropped, there are a few reasons I could mention for that:
			 	<ol>
					<li><h4>Piracy</h4></li>
					<p>The anime doesn't earn as much as it used to back in the day, when the internet wasn't as common or fast as  
					as it is nowadays. That leads to less enthusiasm to work in an industry, that offers low wages and long hours
					</p>
					<li><h4>The lack of new talent</h4></li>
					<p>The low income and long hours, make it undesirable to work for an anime studio, which stops young fresh
					talent from giving the anime creation a chance as a possible career. That in turn leads to less new and creative ideas
					repetition and lack of originality have therefor become a common issue for new anime.</p>
					<li><h4>The retirement or death of good anime creators</h4></li>
			 		<p> Which has lowered the general standard for new animes in the future, since there is less competition and creativity
			 		</p>
	 			</ol>

		 	<li><h3>Detective Conan(also known as cold case):</h3>
		 		
			 	<a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Detective-Conan/Episode-001?id=12071"><img src="http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/9a7a5344da62f8ef696654e5ec363b6c1413505831_full.jpg"; alt="click here to watch online"></a>

					 	<li><p>This shaped a lot of my personality and way of thinking. This anime is no less than a masterpiece. A teenage detective
					 	who was forced to take a pill, that ended up shrinking him into a 6 year old boy, keeping his intellectual abilities and 
					 	memories. He ends up living with his crush and her loser detective father, who don't know his true identity.
					 	Whenever they are faced with a case, once he has it all figured out he drugs his crush's father, and uses a device</br>
					 	to manipulate his voice to sound like him, and solve the case in his stead.
					 	The creativity and complexity of the cases, as well as the huge number of them, is still a mystery to me.
					 	I was so proud when one time I figured out the whole case before Conan(the fake name for the young boy, a 
					 	reference to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
					 	And yes, Shinichi Kudo(the teenage detective) was my first ever crush!
					 	I spent 5 euros each month to get the new manga, it really was the main form of entertainment I had as a young
					 	kid. My dad would not have approved if he knew about it, he would always say it is too violent
					 	My mom didn't mind as much lol.

		 		<a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Kamikaze-Kaitou-Jeanne/Episode-001?id=18209"; alt="click here to watch online"><img src="http://images.gogoanime.tv/images/anime/K/Kamikaze-Kaitou-Jeanne.jpg"; alt="click here to watch online"></a>
			 	<ul>
				 	<li><p>The first truly romantic anime I watched, she was an orphan who was chosen to be a reincarnation of Jeanne D'Arc
				 	("Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc,[5] IPA: [ʒan daʁk]; 6 January c. 1412[6] – 30 May 1431), nicknamed "The Maid of Orléans"
				 	 (French: La Pucelle d'Orléans), is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Lancastrian phase of the Hundred Years'
				 	  War, and was canonized as a Roman Catholic saint.", Wikipidea).
				 	  I did not watch <b>Sailor Moon</b>, I wasn't a fan, however I loved this superhero girl version.</li>
				 	</p></ul>
				 	<li><h3>HunterXHunter:</h3></li>
				 	<a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Hunter-x-Hunter-2011/Episode-001?id=115863"><img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/hunterxhunter/images/d/de/Hunterxhunter-2011-ryodan-arc.png/revision/latest?cb=20120528094808"; alt="click here to watch online">

			<ul>	
					<li><p>
					 	This is probably the anime my kids are going to watch(if I ever have kids). It taught me a lot about pure friendship
					 	, about being brave, honest and kind. It is about Gon who found out his dad was still alive and actually left him
					 	with his aunt as a baby to pursue being a hunter. That however didn't make Gon hate his father, it actually
					 	made him want to become a hunter himself so he can meet his father one day(who is an incredible and well known hunter).
					 	On his journey he meets killua, who was raised in a family full of assasins. He escaped them to try and choose his own
					 	way to live. They end up being best friends.I actually had avoided this anime because of Gon's hair for the longest time
					 	possible, until I found out my aunt watched it, so I started watching it with her. It surpassed all of my low expectations!
					 	<b>Fun fact;</b> This show was made by the husband of the woman who made <em>Phantom Thief Jeanne</em> (power couple!)
					 </p></li>

					 	<li><h2>Death Note: Best anime I watched when I was a teenager</h2>
					 	<a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Death-Note/Episode-001-Rebirth?id=93417"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpAypmB1tt_ittYuIAIihqnLqy0D1DpSdIwNqBN9FlIjfFqA602Q"; alt="click here to watch online">
					 	</a>
					 	<p>
					 	This anime is incredible! Yagami Light, a very intelligent Japanese student, who had strong moral convictions finds
					 	a a notebook, that had the title <b>Death Note</b> on the front cover. Turns out that it is the most dangerous weapon
					 	a human can own...
					 	You can kill anyone, just knowing their name and face, no evidence, or traces left behind, except for the pages in the
					 	Death Note. The price? You can neither go to heaven or hell if you use one. 
					 	Light uses it to fulfill his sense of justice, killing all the criminal, until he is faced by <b>L.</b> the world's
					 	best detective. Whose name and face are found out first will die, let the game begin... 
					 	</p></li>
					 	<li><h3>Anime I am currently watching</h3>
					 	<h2> Sword Art Online</h2>
					 	<a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Sword-Art-Online/Episode-001?id=87104"></a><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f2/43/f0/f243f00cfe395bad56c2184af693cf04.jpg"; alt="click here to watch online">
					 	</a>
					 	<p>An anime about being trapped in a virtual reality world, created by a crazy game designer, who trapped the players in 
					 	the game, and whoever dies in the game, dies in the real. Their only hope to return to reality alive is to beat the game.
					 	I watch this one usually in bed with my husband, the drawings are beautiful, the story is not bad, but not the best anime 
					 	I have seen out there, it is more relaxing to me, but I still enjoy it.out there. It is kind of romantic, so that is a plus!
					 	</p></li>
					 	<li><h3>Anime I am thinking of watching next</h3>
					 	<h2><a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Shingeki-no-Kyojin-Dub/Episode-001?id=67457"><span>Attack On Titans:</span></a></h2>
					 	<p>My little sister recommended this one, I am sure it will be awesome, since she has never recommended any bad anime to me before
					 	I also want to finish <a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Tokyo-Ghoul/Episode-001?id=97933"><b><span>Tokyo Ghoul</span></b></a> and <a href="http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Clannad/Episode-001?id=1708"><b><span>Clannad</span></b></a>. After that I am not so sure what I will be watching, but I hope
					 	I will find some new good anime when I am done watching those!
