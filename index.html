					<h4>Anime:</h4>
					<p>"A style of japanese animated shows, aimed at adults and children."<br>
					Anime is something that is certainly a big factor that affected who I am today. I would not be the person I am today, <br>
					if I hadn't watched the anime that I watched in my childhood and teenage years, that I am a 100% sure of. Seeing so <br>
					manycharacters grow and evolve over the years, is something that people in the past didn't have the chance to experience <br>
					the way my generation and the following ones have.It is very special and the anime shows have changed a lot over time, <br>
					so each one of them is more closely related to specific generations than others.<br>
				 	Truth is; I don't have a  clear idea of what kind of anime is popular nowadays, however, I sadly believe that the quality<br>
				 	has dropped, there are a few reasons I could mention for that:
				<h4>1.Piracy</h4>
				<p>The anime doesn't earn as much as it used to back in the day, when the internet wasn't as common or fast as <br> 
					as it is nowadays. That leads to less enthusiasm to work in an industry, that offers low wages and long hours<br>
				</p>
				<h4>2.The lack of new talent</h4>
				<p>The low income and long hours, make it undesirable to work for an anime studio, which stops young fresh<br>
					talent from giving the anime creation a chance as a possible career. That in turn leads to less new and creative ideas<br>
					repetition and lack of originality have therefor become a common issue for new anime.</p>
				<h4>3.The retirement or death of good anime creators</h4>
				 <p> which has lowered the general standard for new animes in the future, since there is less competition and creativity<br>
				 </p>
				 <h1>My childhood friends:</h1>
				 <h3>1.Detective Conan(also known as cold case):</h3>
				 <img src="http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire1/9a7a5344da62f8ef696654e5ec363b6c1413505831_full.jpg"> 
				 <p>This shaped a lot of my personality and way of thinking. This anime is no less than a masterpiece. A teenage detective<br>
				 	who was forced to take a pill, that ended up shrinking him into a 6 year old boy, keeping his intellectual abilities and <br>
				 	memories. He ends up living with his crush and her loser detective father, who don't know his true identity.<br>
				 	Whenever they are faced with a case, once he has it all figured out he drugs his crush's father, and uses a device</br>
				 	to manipulate his voice to sound like him, and solve the case in his stead.<br>
				 	The creativity and complexity of the cases, as well as the huge number of them, is still a mystery to me.<br>
				 	I was so proud when one time I figured out the whole case before Conan(the fake name for the young boy, a <br>
				 	reference to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).<br>
				 	And yes, Shinichi Kudo(the teenage detective) was my first ever crush!<br>
				 	I spent 5 euros each month to get the new manga, it really was the main form of entertainment I had as a young<br>
				 	kid. My dad would not have approved if he knew about it, he would always say it is too violent<br>
				 	My mom didn't mind as much lol.
				 </p>
				 <h3>2.Phantom Thief Jeanne:</h3>
				 <img src="http://images.gogoanime.tv/images/anime/K/Kamikaze-Kaitou-Jeanne.jpg">
				 <p>The first truly romantic anime I watched, she was an orphan who was chosen to be a reincarnation of Jeanne D'Arc<br>
				 	("Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc,[5] IPA: [ʒan daʁk]; 6 January c. 1412[6] – 30 May 1431), nicknamed "The Maid of Orléans"<br>
				 	 (French: La Pucelle d'Orléans), is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Lancastrian phase of the Hundred Years'<br>
				 	  War, and was canonized as a Roman Catholic saint.", Wikipidea).<br>
				 	  I did not watch <b>Sailor Moon</b>, I wasn't a fan, however I loved this superhero girl version.<br>
				 </p>
				 <h3>HunterXHunter:</h3>
				 <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/hunterxhunter/images/d/de/Hunterxhunter-2011-ryodan-arc.png/revision/latest?cb=20120528094808">
				 <p>
				 	This is probably the anime my kids are going to watch(if I ever have kids). It taught me a lot about pure friendship<br>
				 	, about being brave, honest and kind. It is about Gon who found out his dad was still alive and actually left him<br>
				 	with his aunt as a baby to pursue being a hunter.<br> That however didn't make Gon hate his father, it actually<br>
				 	made him want to become a hunter himself so he can meet his father one day(who is an incredible and well known hunter).<br>
				 	On his journey he meets killua, who was raised in a family full of assasins. He escaped them to try and choose his own<br>
				 	way to live. They end up being best friends.I actually had avoided this anime because of Gon's hair for the longest time<br>
				 	possible, until I found out my aunt watched it, so I started watching it with her. It surpassed all of my low expectations!<br>
				 	<b>Fun fact;</b> This show was made by the husband of the woman who made <emp>Phantom Thief Jeanne</emp> (power couple!)

				 <h2>Death Note: Best anime I watched when I was a teenager</h2>
				 <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQpAypmB1tt_ittYuIAIihqnLqy0D1DpSdIwNqBN9FlIjfFqA602Q">
				 <p>
				 	This anime is incredible! Yagami Light, a very intelligent Japanese student, who had strong moral convictions finds<br>
				 	a a notebook, that had the title <b>Death Note</b> on the front cover. Turns out that it is the most dangerous weapon<br>
				 	a human can own...<br>
				 	You can kill anyone, just knowing their name and face, no evidence, or traces left behind, except for the pages in the<br>
				 	Death Note. The price? You can neither go to heaven or hell if you use one.<br> 
				 	Light uses it to fulfill his sense of justice, killing all the criminal, until he is faced by <b>L.</b> the world's<br>
				 	best detective. Whose name and face are found out first will die, let the game begin...<br> 
				 </p> 
				 <h3>Anime I am currently watching</h3>
				 <h2> Sword Art Online</h2>
				 <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f2/43/f0/f243f00cfe395bad56c2184af693cf04.jpg">
				 <p>An anime about being trapped in a virtual reality world, created by a crazy game designer, who trapped the players in <br>
				 	the game, and whoever dies in the game, dies in the real. Their only hope to return to reality alive is to beat the game.<br>
				 	I watch this one usually in bed with my husband, the drawings are beautiful, the story is not bad, but not the best anime <br>
				 	I have seen out there, it is more relaxing to me, but I still enjoy it.out there. It is kind of romantic, so that is a plus!<br>
				 </p>
				 <h3>Anime I am thinking of watching next</h3>
				 <h1>Attack On Titans:</h1>
				 <p>My little sister recommended this one, I am sure it will be awesome, since she has never recommended any bad anime to me before<br>
				 	I also want to finish <b> Tokyo Ghoul</b> and <b>Clannad</b>. After that I am not so sure what I will be watching, but I hope<br>
				 	I will find some new good anime when I am done watching those!
